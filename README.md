# What is Pokédex

The Pokédex is a fictional device in the Pokémon world that serves as a Pokémon encyclopedia. It is given to trainers to record data about encountered Pokémon, including type, height, weight, and other information. The goal is to complete the Pokédex by gathering data on as many Pokémon species as possible during their journey.
